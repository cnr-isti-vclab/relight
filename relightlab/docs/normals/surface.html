<h2>Generate a 3D surface</h2>

<!-- Normal maps can be integrated to create a 3d surface. This process has two main limitations: 
one is error accumulation, the other is dealing with discontinuties -->

<h3>Fourier normal integration</h3>

<p>Fast method to integrate the normals, it will generate a dense mesh with many triangles, you might want to downsample the
normal map to generate more manageable meshes.</p>
<p>Main drawback is that this method cannot handle discontinuities.</p>


<h3 id="bni">Bilateral normal integration</h3>

<p>Similar to fourier normal integration method (dense mesh) but can deal with discontinuities in depth, but can be extremely slow</p>
<P>A parameter called "Discontiuity propensity" defines how likely a jump in depth is likely to be recognized as a discontinuity.</p>



<h3 id="assm">Adaptive surface meshing</h3>
<p>This method cannot deal with discontinuities but will produce a more manageable mesh with higher density at surface features.</p>
<p>A parameter called "Mesh error in pixels", controls how closely you want the simplified mesh to follow the surface. Higher values result in less triangles.</p>
<!-- cannot deal with discontinuities but the resulting mesh is reasonably small. Slow.
A parameter controls the precision of the output -->
