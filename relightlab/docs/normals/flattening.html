<h2>Flattening normals</h2>

<p>Normal directions might be warped due do missing or inaccureate 3D lights position calibration.</p>
<p>I might also be hard to take account of other phenomena such as vignetting (it is a work in progress)</P> 
<p>If we already know that the object is reasonably flat, we can compute and apply a transformation
to force the normals back on an average plane</p>

<h3 id="radial">Radial flattening</h3>

<p>We fit a second degree polinomial throuugh the normal directions assuming the normals will be flat on average</p>

<h3 id="fourier">Fourier flattening</h3>

<p>Here we decompoose normal frequencies (like sound) and filter low frequencies, global deformationa can be removed</p>
<p>The parameter "Fourier high-pass frequency" specify the lowest frequency that wont be cut and is expressed
as a percentage of the dataset width.</p>
<p>20% seems to be a reasonable value for deformatins caused by the wrong light positions, but you might also use it to
remove smaller geometry features by lowering the value.</p>

<h3 id="blur">Gaussian blur</h3>

<p>Similar to fourier we can remove low frequency applying a gaussian blur and then removing it from the normalmap.</p>
<p>Blur parameter defines the amount of blur in percentage of the image width</p>
