<h2>Cropping</h2>

<p>In the crop tab you can define a rectangular region (optionally rotated) to be exported in the
RTI, Normals and BRDF tabs.</p>

<p>The <em>Crop images...</em> allows you to quickly crop images of your choice (provided the size is consistend with the size of the dataset)
 and export them in a different folder.</p>
