<h2>Align</h2>

<p>RTI and normal computations require all the images to be taken from the same view-point. All the 
images needs to be perfectly aligned for good results: ghosting or blurring will be generated otherwise.</p>

<p>You can verify and eventually correct the alignment of the images but first create a new alignment by clicking the button
and then select a small rectangle by clicking on the image.</p>

<p>The application will collect the same patch from all the images and you can inspect the alignment using the verify
button. You can also change the alignent of an image dragging the cross and make sure that the cross has the same position
relative to the content of the thumbnails.</p>

<p>You might want to carefully select the patches: the best ones are usually flat regions with some texture details,
placing a small printed marker on the edge of the image before capturing the dataset is advised and is a perfect target
for verifying the alignment. In general avoid regions with shadows or reflections.</p>
