<h2>Median image</h2>

<p>The median image allwos to compute something close to the albedo, but interesting result
can be obtained sorting the pixels by luminosity and picking a certain percentile</p;>
<p>The slider will pick the darkest pixel from every image when set to zero, the brightest
when set to 100 (can work as a makeshift specularity) and 60% is a good compromise
to quickly generate an image that can work as an albedo.</p>
